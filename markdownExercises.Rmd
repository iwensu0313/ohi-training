### Training Exercise
*This is my text in R Markdown*

Here are the things I have learned today:

1. There are extremely useful help documents and cheatsheets in R Studio
2. `plot()` can plot many types of R objects


### Training Notes

* Use `echo = FALSE` when you don't want a code chunk to appear in your knitted document.
* You can run example functions in the Help page directly with "command"+"return"
